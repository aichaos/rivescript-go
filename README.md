## Introduction

This is a RiveScript interpreter library written for the Go programming
language. RiveScript is a scripting language for chatterbots, making it easy
to write trigger/response pairs for building up a bot's intelligence.

**This project is currently in Beta status.** The API should be mostly stable
but things might move around on you.

## About RiveScript

RiveScript is a scripting language for authoring chatbots. It has a very
simple syntax and is designed to be easy to read and fast to write.

A simple example of what RiveScript looks like:

```
+ hello bot
- Hello human.
```

This matches a user's message of "hello bot" and would reply "Hello human."
Or for a slightly more complicated example:

```
+ my name is *
* <formal> == <bot name> => <set name=<formal>>Wow, we have the same name!
* <get name> != undefined => <set name=<formal>>Did you change your name?
- <set name=<formal>>Nice to meet you, <get name>!
```

The official website for RiveScript is https://www.rivescript.com/

To test drive RiveScript in your web browser, try the
[RiveScript Playground](https://play.rivescript.com/).

## Installation

For the development library:

`go get github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go`

For the stand-alone `rivescript` binary for testing a bot:

`go get github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go/cmd/rivescript`

## Usage

The distribution of RiveScript includes an interactive shell for testing your
RiveScript bot. Run it with the path to a folder on disk that contains your
RiveScript documents. Example:

```bash
# (Linux)
$ rivescript eg/brain

# (Windows)
> rivescript.exe eg/brain
```

See `rivescript -help` for options it accepts, including debug mode and UTF-8
mode.

When used as a library for writing your own chatbot, the synopsis is as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new bot with the default settings.
    bot := rivescript.New(nil)

    // To enable UTF-8 mode, you'd have initialized the bot like:
    bot = rivescript.New(rivescript.WithUTF8())

    // Load a directory full of RiveScript documents (.rive files)
    err := bot.LoadDirectory("eg/brain")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Error loading from directory: %s", err)
    }

    // Load an individual file.
    err = bot.LoadFile("./testsuite.rive")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Error loading from file: %s", err)
    }

    // Sort the replies after loading them!
    bot.SortReplies()

    // Get a reply.
    reply, err := bot.Reply("local-user", "Hello, bot!")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Error: %s\n", err)
    } else {
      fmt.Printf("The bot says: %s", reply)
    }
}
```

## Configuration

The constructor takes an optional `Config` struct. Here is a full example with
all the supported options. You only need to provide keys that are different to
the defaults.

```go
bot := rivescript.New(&rivescript.Config{
    Debug: false,                 // Debug mode, off by default
    Strict: false,                // No strict syntax checking
    UTF8: false,                  // No UTF-8 support enabled by default
    Depth: 50,                    // Becomes default 50 if Depth is <= 0
    Seed: time.Now().UnixNano(),  // Random number seed (default is == 0)
    SessionManager: memory.New(), // Default in-memory session manager
})
```

For convenience, you can use a shortcut:

```go
// A nil config uses all the defaults.
bot = rivescript.New(nil)

// WithUTF8 enables UTF-8 mode (other settings left as default).
bot = rivescript.New(rivescript.WithUTF8())
```

## Object Macros

A common feature in many RiveScript implementations is the object macro, which
enables you to write dynamic program code (in your favorite programming
language) to add extra capabilities to your bot. For example, your bot could
answer a question of "what is the weather like in *$location*" by running some
code to look up their answer via a web API.

The Go version of RiveScript has support for object macros written in Go
(at compile time of your application). It also has optional support for
JavaScript object macros using the [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) library.

Here is how to define a Go object macro:

```go
bot.SetSubroutine(func(rs *rivescript.RiveScript, args []string) string {
    return "Hello world!"
})
```

### JavaScript Object Macros

Here is an example how to make JavaScript object macros available via
the [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) module:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go"
    "github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go/lang/javascript"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize RiveScript first.
    bot := rivescript.New(rivescript.WithUTF8())

    // Add the JavaScript object macro handler.
    js := javascript.New(bot)
    bot.SetHandler("javascript", js)

    // You can access the goja VM and set your own global
    // variable or function bindings to be called from your
    // object macros.
    js.VM.Set("helloFunc", func(name string) string {
        return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)
    })

    // Load some RiveScript code. This example just tests the
    // JavaScript object macro support.
    err := bot.Stream(`
        > object add javascript
          let a = args[0];
          let b = args[1];
          return parseInt(a) + parseInt(b);
        < object

        > object fn javascript
          let result = helloFunc(args[0])
          return result
        < object

        + add # and #
        - <star1> + <star2> = <call>add <star1> <star2></call>

        + say hello *
        - <call>fn <star></call>
    `)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Error loading RiveScript document: %s", err)
    }

    // Sort the replies after loading them!
    bot.SortReplies()

    // Get some replies!
    inputs := []string{"add 5 and 12", "say hello goja"}
    for _, message := range inputs {
      fmt.Printf("You said: %s\n", message)
        reply, err := bot.Reply("local-user", message)
        if err != nil {
          fmt.Printf("Error: %s\n", err)
        } else {
          fmt.Printf("The bot says: %s\n", reply)
        }
    }
}
```

## UTF-8 Support

UTF-8 support in RiveScript is considered an experimental feature. It is
disabled by default.

By default (without UTF-8 mode on), triggers may only contain basic ASCII
characters (no foreign characters), and the user's message is stripped of all
characters except letters, numbers and spaces. This means that, for example,
you can't capture a user's e-mail address in a RiveScript reply, because of
the @ and . characters.

When UTF-8 mode is enabled, these restrictions are lifted. Triggers are only
limited to not contain certain metacharacters like the backslash, and the
user's message is only stripped of backslashes and HTML angled brackets
(to protect from obvious XSS if you use RiveScript in a web application).
Additionally, common punctuation characters are stripped out, with the default
set being `/[.,!?;:]/g`. This can be overridden by providing a new regexp
string literal to the `RiveScript.SetUnicodePunctuation` function. Example:

```go
// Make a new bot with UTF-8 mode enabled.
bot := rivescript.New(rivescript.WithUTF8())

// Override the punctuation characters that get stripped
// from the user's message.
bot.SetUnicodePunctuation(`[.,!?;:]`);
```

The `<star>` tags in RiveScript will capture the user's "raw" input, so you can
write replies to get the user's e-mail address or store foreign characters in
their name.

## Building

I use a GNU Makefile to make building and running this module easier. The
relevant commands are:

* `make setup` - run this after freshly cloning this repo. It runs the
  `git submodule` commands to pull down vendored dependencies.
* `make build` - this will build the front-end command from `cmd/rivescript`
  and place its binary into the `bin/` directory. It builds a binary relevant
  to your current system, so on Linux this will create a Linux binary.
  It's also recommended to run this one at least once, because it will cache
  dependency packages and speed up subsequent builds and runs.
* `make run` - runs the front-end command and points it to the `eg/brain` folder
  as its RiveScript source.
* `make fmt` - runs `gofmt -w` on all the source files.
* `make test` - runs the unit tests.
* `make clean` - cleans up the `.gopath`, `bin` and `dist` directories.

### Testing

The rivescript-go repo submodules the RiveScript Test Suite (rsts) project.
If you didn't do a `git clone --recursive` for rivescript-go you can pull the
submodule via the following commands:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then `make test` (or `go test`) should show results from the tests run
out of the rsts/ folder.

### Releasing

You can build a release for an individual platform by running a command like
`make linux/amd64`. The valid build targets are currently as follows:

* Linux: `linux/386` and `linux/amd64`
* Windows: `windows/386` and `windows/amd64`
* MacOS: `darwin/amd64`

Run `make release` to automatically build releases for all supported platforms.

A directory for the release is created in `dist/rivescript-$VERSION-$OS-$ARCH/`
that contains the built binary, README.md, Changes.md and examples. You can
inspect this directory afterwards; its contents are automatically tarred up
(zip for Windows) and placed in the root of the git repo.

If you are cross-compiling for a different system, you may need to mess with
permissions so that Go can download the standard library for the new target.
Example:

```bash
% sudo mkdir /usr/lib/golang/pkg/windows_386
% chown your_user:your_user /usr/lib/golang/pkg/windows_386
```

  code and returning an "abstract syntax tree."
* [rivescript-go/macro](./macro) - Contains an interface for creating your own

* [rivescript-go/sessions](./sessions) - Contains the interface for user
  variable session managers as well as the default in-memory manager and the
  `NullStore` for testing. Other official session managers (e.g. Redis) are in
  here as well.
